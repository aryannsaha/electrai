# ElectrAI

Electronic Artificial Intelligence (ElectrAI) is a framework for predicting the electronic structure of materials using computer vision models. Given a low-level charge density, the model enhances the representation, ultimately providing a near-DFT charge density modeling.

Model training:
```
python3 ./src/electrai/entrypoints/main.py train --config  ./src/electrai/configs/config.yaml
```
