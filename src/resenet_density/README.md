# software/pyscf

A copy of PySCF for data generation. Not needed for model inference.

# software/resnet

Implementation of the ResNet model for density prediction.

# data/

Some examples of data and scripts for generating them. Filenames with atomh1e indicate the SAD guess density, atomh1e2 indicates the worsened SAD guess, and otherwise means the DFT converged density. \

# examples/

An example of training and an example of inference.

# Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models are available at doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25365508.

# Software Dependencies

All training and prediction were run with PyTorch 1.11.0, Python 3.10.10 on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.\
All data generation was performed with PySCF (see software/pyscf), NumPy 1.24.2, SciPy 1.8.0, H5py 3.8.0 and Python 3.10.4 on Fedora 7.2 (Maipo).

# Installation
